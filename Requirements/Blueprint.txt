Lesson (Summary & Teaching Text)
Summary (copyright-safe teaching text):

The Wise Owl lives in a quiet forest. Every night the owl sits on a high branch and watches the animals. The owl is called wise because it listens first, thinks carefully, and then helps the other animals by giving good advice. In the story, a rabbit worries about a lost path and the owl helps by asking questions and noticing small traces on the ground. The animals learn that listening and thinking calmly are important when solving problems.

Moral: Being wise means thinking carefully and listening before acting.
