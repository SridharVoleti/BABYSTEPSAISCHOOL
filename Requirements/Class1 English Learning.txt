English Language: Class 1, Day 1 (Ages 6)

(Approximate Duration: 15-20 minutes of focused interaction)

Priya's Note: This lesson introduces the self (I), the core action of observation (see - correcting 'vid' to 'see'), and two simple nouns (dog and ball). The pace is slow, building on repetition and using the students' responses immediately. We use Hindi to ground the first concepts.

Phase 1: Introducing the "Self" (I)

Priya: Hello, Rhea and Rohan! Welcome! We’re going to learn English today. We will build it up like building blocks, piece by piece. Don’t worry about getting stuck; if you find something difficult, that is a sign for me to teach better. You do not need to write anything down. Just listen and speak! Ready? (Hindi Translation: Aapko kuch likhna nahi hai. Koi ghabrana nahi. Hum sab kuch saath mein seekhenge.)

Rhea: Yes!
Rohan: Ready!

Priya: In English, when we talk about ourselves, we say I. This is the most important word. It is like saying "Mai" or "Main hoon" in Hindi. Can you both say I?

Rhea & Rohan: I.

Priya: Excellent. That's word one done!

Phase 2: Introducing the Action (See)

Priya: Now, let’s learn an action. The action for look or dekho. The word is see. Say see.

Rhea & Rohan: See.

Priya: Look how simple English is. To say "I see", you just put the two words together: I see. Rhea, how do you say "I see"?

Rhea: I see.

Priya: Fantastic! Rohan, how do you say "I see"?

Rohan: I see.

Phase 3: Introducing Nouns and the Article (Dog, Ball, A)

Priya: Now let’s add the things we can see. Let’s learn the word for a friendly animal: dog. Can you say dog?

Rhea & Rohan: Dog.

Priya: And another fun object: ball. Say ball.

Rhea & Rohan: Ball.

Priya: Now, in English, when we talk about one dog or one ball, we use the little word a in front of it. So, we say a dog and a ball. Rhea, try to say: "I see a dog."

Rhea: I see a dog.

Priya: Brilliant! That is a perfect English sentence. Rohan, how do you say: "I see a ball"?

Rohan: I see a ball.

Priya: Let’s mix it up. Rhea, try this: "I see a ball."

Rhea: I see a ball.

Priya: Rohan, how do you say: "I see a dog"?

Rohan: I see a dog.

Phase 4: Introducing the Connective (And)

Priya: Wonderful! You can make two sentences. Now, how do we join two things together? The word is and. This is the same as saying "aur" in Hindi. Say and.

Rhea & Rohan: And.

Priya: Rhea, how do you say: "I see a dog and a ball."

Rhea: I see a dog and a ball.

Priya: Amazing! Rohan, tell me how to say: "I see a ball and a dog."

Rohan: I see a ball and a dog.

Priya: Now, let's take away the "I see" part. Rhea, just say the two things joined together: "a dog and a ball."

Rhea: A dog and a ball.

Priya: Rohan, "a ball and a dog."

Rohan: A ball and a dog.

Review and Next Step

Priya: You learned six words today: I (Mai), see (Dekho), dog, ball, a, and and (Aur). And you can already make complex sentences like "I see a dog and a ball." Tomorrow, we will learn about actions you do, not just things you see! Excellent work today!

English Language: Class 1, Day 2 (Ages 6)

(Approximate Duration: 15-20 minutes of focused interaction)

Priya's Note: This lesson introduces new actions (jump, run) and a new animal (cat). The crucial step is moving from I see... to I do... and combining these two types of sentences with and.

Phase 1: Quick Review and Recall

Priya: Welcome back, Rhea and Rohan! Let's do a super-fast check of the blocks we learned yesterday. No hesitation!

Priya: How do you say Mai?
Rhea & Rohan: I.

Priya: How do you say Dekho?
Rhea & Rohan: See.

Priya: If you want to talk about one dog?
Rhea & Rohan: A dog.

Priya: If you want to talk about one ball?
Rhea & Rohan: A ball.

Priya: How do you say Aur (to join two things)?
Rhea & Rohan: And.

Priya: Excellent! You remember the six most important words. Let’s put them in a sentence. Rhea, how do you say: "I see a ball and a dog."
Rhea: I see a ball and a dog.

Priya: Perfect! Rohan, you say: "I see a dog and a ball."
Rohan: I see a dog and a ball.

Phase 2: Introducing Action 1 (Jump)

Priya: Yesterday we learned about things we see. Now let's learn about things we do. The first action word is jump. Say jump.

Rhea & Rohan: Jump.

Priya: Jump is the same in English and Hindi (Koodna). Now, if you want to say that you are doing this action, you put I in front. Rhea, how do you say: "I jump."

Rhea: I jump.

Priya: Great. Now, this is a fun test! Use our connector word and to join the action you do with the thing you see. Rohan, how do you say: "I jump, and I see a dog."

Rohan: I jump, and I see a dog.

Priya: Fantastic. Rhea, you say: "I jump, and I see a ball."

Rhea: I jump, and I see a ball.

Phase 3: Introducing Action 2 (Run)

Priya: Excellent. Let’s learn another action. When you move very fast with your legs (daudna), the word is run. Say run.

Rhea & Rohan: Run.

Priya: Rohan, how do you say: "I run."

Rohan: I run.

Priya: Now, let's join your two actions! Rhea, how do you say: "I jump and I run."

Rhea: I jump and I run.

Priya: Amazing! Rohan, how do you say: "I run and I jump." (Just switching the order)

Rohan: I run and I jump.

Phase 4: Introducing New Noun (Cat)

Priya: We learned dog. Let’s learn a similar animal: cat. Say cat.

Rhea & Rohan: Cat.

Priya: Just like before, when we talk about one of them, we say a cat. Rhea, tell me: "I see a cat."

Rhea: I see a cat.

Priya: Rohan, let's use both animals. How do you say: "I see a cat and a dog."

Rohan: I see a cat and a dog.

Priya: Yes! Now, let's put everything together. Rhea, listen carefully: "I see a cat, and I jump."

Rhea: I see a cat, and I jump.

Phase 5: The Grand Synthesis (All 9 Words)

Priya: This is the biggest sentence yet! I want you to join three parts: I jump, and I run, and I see a ball. Rohan, your turn!

Rohan: I jump, and I run, and I see a ball.

Priya: Unbelievable! Now Rhea, you say: I run, and I see a dog, and I jump. (Mixing the order)

Rhea: I run, and I see a dog, and I jump.

Review and Next Step

Priya: You used all the words we have learned so far: I, see, a, dog, ball, and, jump, run, cat. You have nine words now, and you can build any combination of sentences with them! Excellent work today! Tomorrow we will learn about go and play.

English Language: Class 1, Day 3 (Ages 6)

(Approximate Duration: 15-20 minutes of focused interaction)

Priya's Note: This lesson introduces new verbs (go, play) and the first simple adjectives (good, bad). The goal is to build simple descriptive phrases like "a good dog" and combine multiple actions: "I jump and I play."

Phase 1: Full Review and Recall

Priya: Good morning, Rhea and Rohan! Let's say all nine of our words quickly. Rhea, your turn first:
Rhea: I, see, a, dog, ball, and, jump, run, cat.

Priya: Excellent! Rohan, how do you say: "I see a cat and a dog."
Rohan: I see a cat and a dog.

Priya: Amazing. Now, the action sentence. Rhea, how do you say: "I run and I jump."
Rhea: I run and I jump.

Phase 2: Introducing Adjective 1 & 2 (Good and Bad)

Priya: We know what we see and what we do. Now, let's learn how to describe things. The first description word is good (Acha). Say good.
Rhea & Rohan: Good.

Priya: The opposite is bad (Bura). Say bad.
Rhea & Rohan: Bad.

Priya: In English, the description word goes before the thing. So, to describe one dog, we say a good dog. Rohan, how do you say: "a good cat"?
Rohan: A good cat.

Priya: Perfect! Rhea, how do you say: "I see a bad dog."
Rhea: I see a bad dog.

Priya: Now join them! Rohan, how do you say: "I see a good dog and a bad cat."
Rohan: I see a good dog and a bad cat.

Phase 3: Introducing Action 3 (Go)

Priya: Let’s learn a new action: go (Jaana). Say go.

Phase 5: The Grand Synthesis (All 13 Words)

Priya: Ready for the biggest challenge? We are going to use two actions and two descriptions! Listen carefully, Rohan: "I go, and I see a good ball, and I play."

Rohan: I go, and I see a good ball, and I play.

Priya: Amazing! Rhea, your final mega-sentence: "I run, and I jump, and I see a bad cat."

Rhea: I run, and I jump, and I see a bad cat.

Review and Next Step

Priya: You learned four new words today: go, play, good, bad. You now know thirteen English words, and you can describe things! Tomorrow, we will learn how to say you own things and what you like!

English Language: Class 1, Day 4 (Ages 6)

(Approximate Duration: 15-20 minutes of focused interaction)

Rohan: I have a kite.

Priya: Now, let's join having and doing! Rhea, "I have a ball, and I jump."
Rhea: I have a ball, and I jump.

Priya: Rohan, this is a long one! "I see a good dog, and I have a ball, and I go."
Rohan: I see a good dog, and I have a ball, and I go.

Phase 4: Introducing Verb of Opinion (Like)

Priya: Great! Let's learn the word for when you enjoy something: like (Pasand Karna). Say like.
Rhea & Rohan: Like.

Priya: Rohan, how do you say you enjoy the new item: "I like a kite."

Rohan: I have a good ball, and I like a cat.

Phase 5: The Grand Synthesis (All 16 Words)

Priya: Final test! Let's use like, have, and an action. Rhea, your sentence is: "I like a kite, and I have a ball, and I play."

Rhea: A big blue house.

Priya: Super! Rohan, combine size and color with something you can see: "I see a small red bird."

Rohan: I see a small red bird.

Phase 5: The Grand Synthesis (All 38 Words)

Review and Next Step

Priya: Absolutely incredible work this week! You learned four new descriptive words: small, big, blue, red. You now know 38 words and can make complex sentences describing size, color, location, action, and family! You are ready for Week 3!

English Language: Class 1, Day 11 (Ages 6)

(Approximate Duration: 15-20 minutes of focused interaction)

Priya's Note: This lesson introduces two critical concepts: 1. Pluralizing Nouns (adding -s) and 2. Plural Subject Pronoun (they). We use the plural form of the 'To Be' verb, are, to describe them.

Phase 1: Full Review and Consolidation

Priya: Good morning! We ended the week knowing 38 words! Let's start with a big description sentence. Rohan, tell me: "I see a small red cat, and a big blue kite is there."
Rohan: I see a small red cat, and a big blue kite is there.

Priya: Excellent! Rhea, use family and action: "I have a good mother, and we run and jump."
Rhea: I have a good mother, and we run and jump.

Phase 2: Introducing Plural Nouns (-s)

Priya: We know one dog. When we see more than one dog (like two or three), we just add the sound 's' to the end! So one dog becomes two or three dogs. Say dogs.
Rhea & Rohan: Dogs.

Priya: One cat becomes cats. Say cats.
Rhea & Rohan: Cats.

Priya: Rohan, how do you say you see more than one ball? "I see balls."
Rohan: I see balls.

Priya: Rhea, "I like dogs and cats."
Rhea: I like dogs and cats.

Phase 3: Introducing Plural Subject (They)

Priya: We know I (Mai) and we (Hum). When we talk about people or things that are not us, we say they (Vah or Veh). Say they.
Rhea & Rohan: They.

Priya: Now, remember that for they (many), we use the link word are. They are here. Rohan, how do you say: "They are there."
Rohan: They are there.

Priya: Rhea, now describe the group: "They are good and big."
Rhea: They are good and big.

Phase 4: Linking Plural Subjects to Plural Nouns

Priya: We can say dogs instead of they. The sentence is the same! Dogs are here. Rohan, how do you say: "Cats are small."
Rohan: Cats are small.

Priya: Rhea, now join everything! "I see big trees, and they are there."
Rhea: I see big trees, and they are there.

Phase 5: The Grand Synthesis (All 40 Words)

Priya: Final sentence! Rohan, listen carefully: "I eat red apples, and the mothers and fathers are good." (Wait, no articles with plurals yet. Let's simplify). Rohan, try this: "I eat red apples, and good mothers are here."

Rohan: I eat red apples, and good mothers are here.

Priya: Excellent! Rhea, "I see blue birds, and they jump and run."

Rhea: I see blue birds, and they jump and run.

Phase 5: The Grand Synthesis (All 48 Words)

Priya: Final test! Rhea, listen carefully: "I like a small yellow shirt, and a brother wears shoes, and he is here." (Using 'he is here' to refer to 'brother' requires the pronoun 'he'. Let's stick to nouns for now.) Rhea, try this: "I wear a big dress, and a good mother is there, and I eat an apple."

Rhea: I wear a big dress, and a good mother is there, and I eat an apple.
