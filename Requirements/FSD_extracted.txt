1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.
This document translates the BabySteps PRD v2.0 into implementable, testable functional and non-functional requirements. Phase 1 is specified at full engineering detail. Phases 2–4 are described at feature level and will be elaborated in subsequent FSD releases prior to each phase start.
1.2 Requirement ID Convention
BS-[MODULE]-[SEQ]-[F/NF] where MODULE is a 3-letter code, SEQ is a 3-digit number, F = Functional, NF = Non-Functional.
Enhanced Requirements (v2.1):• This requirement SHALL define explicit failure handling and graceful degradation paths.• A single authoritative source of truth SHALL be designated for all critical state.• All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be explainable and auditable.• Anti-gaming and abuse-resistance controls SHALL be enforced.• Observability (metrics, logs, alerts) SHALL cover success, failure, and degradation paths.• Cognitive load limits SHALL be enforced as per age group.
1.3 Priority Definitions
1.4 Phase 1 Delivery Summary
Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1–3, Mar–May 2026)
Delivery: Private Alpha — 500 families, CBSE Grades 1–5, Hindi + English, Android app.
What a student can do at end of Phase 1:
Parent registers with mobile + OTP, completes DPDP consent, creates child profile
Child logs in with picture-code (ages 3–6) or PIN (ages 6–12)
Child takes a 10–15 minute diagnostic → system assigns IQ Level (1/2/3)
Child selects their three languages during onboarding
AI Teacher delivers CBSE Math and English/Hindi concepts for Grades 1–5, adapted to IQ Level
Child answers practice questions and earns 1–5 star ratings
Child cannot progress until achieving 3 stars (mastery gate enforced)
If child doesn't understand, AI reteaches using a different strategy
Child sees a star map dashboard with streaks
Parent sees child's progress, stars, time spent, and daily summary
Parent pays via UPI/Razorpay for Standard subscription
Everything runs on a ₹8,000 Android phone over 4G

Priority: P0
Description: Before ANY child data is collected, the parent MUST read and explicitly consent to data processing per the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. Consent must be verifiable — the system records what was shown, when, and how consent was confirmed.
Trigger: When parent taps "Add Child" for the first time (before the child profile form appears).
Input Flow:
System displays a full-screen Consent Notice in the parent's preferred language
Consent Notice contents (mandatory per DPDP Act Section 6):
◦ What data we collect: Child's first name, date of birth, voice recordings during lessons, learning progress data, question responses, time-on-platform data
◦ Why we collect it: To deliver personalised AI-driven education to your child
◦ How it is used: Data is processed by AI models to adapt teaching to your child's learning level. Data is never used for advertising. Data is never sold to third parties.
◦ Who has access: You (the parent), your child's assigned mentor (if applicable), and BabySteps system administrators for technical support
◦ How long we keep it: Learning data is kept for the duration of enrollment + 1 year. Voice recordings are processed and auto-deleted within 30 days unless you choose to retain them.
◦ Your rights: You can withdraw consent at any time. You can request a copy of all data. You can request deletion of all data. Contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@babysteps.in
Parent must scroll to the bottom of the notice (scroll tracking confirms full read)
Checkbox: "I, [auto-filled parent name], give consent for BabySteps to process my child's personal data as described above"
Checkbox is unchecked by default — parent must actively check it
"I Agree" button (disabled until checkbox is checked AND full scroll confirmed)
Identity Verification — one of:
◦ Method A (preferred): Aadhaar + OTP via DigiLocker — System redirects to DigiLocker OAuth. Parent authenticates. DigiLocker returns verified name + masked Aadhaar. System records DigiLocker verification ID.
◦ Method B: Virtual ID — Parent enters Aadhaar Virtual ID + OTP sent to Aadhaar-linked mobile
◦ Method C: Credit/debit card micro-charge — ₹1 charge to parent's card (refunded) confirms identity via card holder name match. For parents without Aadhaar.
On successful verification: Consent record created (immutable), child profile form is displayed

Priority: P0
Description: Children aged 3–6 log in by tapping their avatar, then selecting 3 pictures in sequence from a grid.
Setup Flow (during profile creation):
System displays instruction to parent: "Help your child choose 3 secret pictures"
A 4×3 grid of 12 pictures is displayed (large tiles 80×80dp): Lotus, Mango, Peacock, Elephant, Cricket Bat, Sun, Moon, Star, Fish, Butterfly, Cow, Train
Parent and child together tap 3 pictures in their chosen order
System confirms: "Your secret pictures are: [Pic1] → [Pic2] → [Pic3]. Remember this!"
Sequence is hashed (bcrypt) and stored
Login Flow:
App home screen shows all student avatars registered on this device (large cards with display name + avatar image, voice narration of name)
Child taps their avatar → voice says "Hello [Display Name]! Tap your secret pictures!"
Same 4×3 grid appears. Pictures are in RANDOMISED positions (different from setup)
Child taps 3 pictures in the correct sequence
Each tap: Picture bounces + sparkle animation + pleasant sound
If correct: Confetti animation + "Welcome back, [Name]!" + redirect to dashboard
If wrong: Friendly wobble animation + "Oops, let's try again!" + grid re-randomises
After 5 wrong attempts: "Let's get a grown-up to help!" + Parent unlock screen (parent enters OTP or device PIN)
Successful login creates a session (JWT, 24-hour expiry)
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Grid randomises picture positions on every login attempt (prevents positional memory)
• AC2: All interactions work without any text reading by the child
• AC3: Audio feedback accompanies every action
• AC4: Login completes in under 15 seconds for a child who knows their pictures
• AC5: Works on 4-inch screens (grid adapts to screen size)

Priority: P0
Description: Students aged 6–12 log in by tapping their avatar, then entering a 4-digit PIN on a numeric keypad.
Setup Flow: Parent sets the 4-digit PIN during profile creation. Student is shown the PIN and asked to enter it once to confirm.
Login Flow:
Student taps their avatar on home screen
"Hi [Name]! Enter your PIN" with a large 3×4+1 numeric keypad (1–9, 0, backspace, enter)
Each digit entered shows a filled dot (●) — PIN is masked
On 4th digit: auto-submit (no need to tap Enter)
If correct: Welcome animation + dashboard
If wrong: Shake + "Try again!" + allow 5 attempts
After 5 failures: Parent unlock required
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Keypad buttons are minimum 56×56dp with 8dp spacing
• AC2: PIN is never displayed on screen (always masked)
• AC3: PIN hash is bcrypt (cost 12), never stored in plain text
• AC4: Parent can reset PIN from parent dashboard (triggers OTP to parent's phone)
• AC5: Auto-submit on 4th digit reduces friction
BS-AUT-006-F | Parent Login — Mobile + OTP
Enhanced Requirements (v2.1):• This requirement SHALL define explicit failure handling and graceful degradation paths.• A single authoritative source of truth SHALL be designated for all critical state.• All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be explainable and auditable.• Anti-gaming and abuse-resistance controls SHALL be enforced.• Observability (metrics, logs, alerts) SHALL cover success, failure, and degradation paths.• Cognitive load limits SHALL be enforced as per age group.

Description: After student profile creation, parent and student choose 3 languages per the NEP 2020 Three-Language Formula.
Flow:
Screen: "Choose [Child Name]'s Three Languages" with explanation: "As per India's education policy, every child learns 3 languages."
Language 1 — Mother Tongue / Regional Language:
◦ Auto-suggested based on parent's state (e.g., Maharashtra → Marathi)
◦ Dropdown with all 22 Scheduled Languages + English
◦ Label: "Your home language"

◦ Smart suggestion: If L1 is Hindi → suggest English. If L1 is non-Hindi → suggest Hindi or English
◦ Same dropdown
◦ Validation: Cannot be same as L1
Language 3:
◦ Smart suggestion: If L1 is regional and L2 is Hindi → suggest English. If L1 is regional and L2 is English → suggest Hindi.
◦ Same dropdown
◦ Validation: Cannot be same as L1 or L2
Validation bar at bottom: Displays "✓ At least 2 Indian languages selected" or "✗ At least 2 languages must be native to India" (per NEP 2020 rule)
System note: "Your child will also learn basic Sanskrit as part of the cultural curriculum."
Confirm: "These are [Child Name]'s languages: [L1], [L2], [L3]" with Edit option
On confirm: Stored in student record. Medium of instruction for ages 3–8 defaults to L1.
Phase 1 Languages Available: Hindi (hi), English (en) — only these two are fully active for content delivery. Other languages can be selected but will show "Content in [language] coming soon — we'll teach in Hindi/English for now."

BS-AUT-008-F | Role-Based Access Control Engine
Enhanced Requirements (v2.1):• This requirement SHALL define explicit failure handling and graceful degradation paths.• A single authoritative source of truth SHALL be designated for all critical state.• All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be explainable and auditable.• Anti-gaming and abuse-resistance controls SHALL be enforced.• Observability (metrics, logs, alerts) SHALL cover success, failure, and degradation paths.• Cognitive load limits SHALL be enforced as per age group.
Priority: P0
Description: Every API request is authorised against the user's role and data scope. Enforced at both API middleware and database (row-level security) layers.
Phase 1 Roles:
Enforcement Logic (every API request):
Extract JWT from Authorization: Bearer <token> header
Validate JWT: Check signature (RS256), expiry, issuer
Extract claims: sub (user_id), role, iat, exp
API middleware checks: Is this role allowed to call this endpoint? (whitelist per role)
If endpoint is allowed, inject scope predicate into database query:
◦ Student calling GET /progress → SELECT * FROM concept_mastery WHERE student_id = $jwt.sub
◦ Parent calling GET /children/:id/progress → SELECT * FROM concept_mastery WHERE student_id = $child_id AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM students WHERE student_id = $child_id AND parent_id = $jwt.sub)
If role check fails: Return HTTP 403 + log to audit_log
If scope check fails (e.g., parent trying to access unlinked child): Return HTTP 403 + log to audit_log
Database Table: audit_log (APPEND-ONLY, partitioned by month)
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Student A's JWT CANNOT retrieve Student B's data — verified via automated penetration test
• AC2: Parent can ONLY access their own linked children — cross-parent access blocked
• AC3: Every denied request is logged with full context
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.
• AC4: JWT with expired token returns 401 (not 403)
• AC5: Audit log table cannot be modified via application code (enforced by DB permissions)
3.2 MODULE: ONBOARDING DIAGNOSTIC (DIA)
BS-DIA-001-F | IQ Level Diagnostic — Ages 3–6
Enhanced Requirements (v2.1):• This requirement SHALL define explicit failure handling and graceful degradation paths.• A single authoritative source of truth SHALL be designated for all critical state.• All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be explainable and auditable.• Anti-gaming and abuse-resistance controls SHALL be enforced.• Observability (metrics, logs, alerts) SHALL cover success, failure, and degradation paths.• Cognitive load limits SHALL be enforced as per age group.

Structure: 15 tasks across 4 domains
Domain 1: Pattern Recognition (5 tasks)
Domain 2: Vocabulary (4 tasks) — AI voice speaks in Language 1 (Hindi/English)
Domain 3: Numeracy (4 tasks)
Domain 4: Instruction Following (2 tasks)
Adaptive Logic:
• Tasks presented in order above (easy → hard within each domain)
• If child gets tasks 1–2 wrong in a domain, skip remaining hard tasks in that domain (move to next domain)
• Total time: 8–12 minutes with generous 30-second timeout per task
IQ Level Calculation:
UI Requirements:
• Every task has AI voice narration in Language 1
• Answer options are large tappable tiles (minimum 80×80dp)
• Correct answer: Star burst animation + "Yay!" sound (regardless of answer — no negative feedback)
• Wrong answer: Same positive animation (child doesn't know they got it wrong)
• Progress: 15 dots at bottom of screen, filling as tasks complete
• "Take a break" option (parent can pause and resume within 24 hours)
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Assessment completes in 8–12 minutes
• AC2: ZERO text appears on any task screen — everything is visual + audio
• AC3: All audio is in child's Language 1 (Hindi or English for Phase 1)
• AC4: Result is shown to parent as "Your child's Learning Level: [Foundation/Standard/Advanced]" — the word "IQ" is NEVER shown to parents or children
• AC5: Result is stored in student record and learning path adapts immediately
• AC6: If child abandons mid-assessment, progress is saved and they can resume within 24 hours
BS-DIA-002-F | IQ Level Diagnostic — Ages 6–12
Enhanced Requirements (v2.1):• This requirement SHALL define explicit failure handling and graceful degradation paths.• A single authoritative source of truth SHALL be designated for all critical state.• All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be explainable and auditable.• Anti-gaming and abuse-resistance controls SHALL be enforced.• Observability (metrics, logs, alerts) SHALL cover success, failure, and degradation paths.• Cognitive load limits SHALL be enforced as per age group.
Priority: P0
Description: Adaptive diagnostic using Item Response Theory (IRT) to assess Math, Reading, and Logical Reasoning abilities and assign IQ Level.
Structure: 25 items, adaptive difficulty
Item Pool (minimum for Phase 1):
• Math: 50 calibrated items across Easy/Medium/Hard (addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, word problems for Grades 1–5)
• Reading Comprehension: 30 calibrated items (passage-based questions in Hindi and English)
• Logical Reasoning: 20 calibrated items (sequences, odd-one-out, analogies)
IRT 3PL Adaptive Algorithm:
Start with a medium-difficulty item (b = 0.0)
After student responds, update ability estimate (θ) using Bayesian updating
Select next item that maximises Fisher information at current θ estimate
Repeat until: Standard Error of θ < 0.30 OR 25 items administered
Final θ estimate determines IQ Level:
◦ θ < -0.5 → Level 1 (Foundation)
◦ -0.5 ≤ θ ≤ +0.5 → Level 2 (Standard)
◦ θ > +0.5 → Level 3 (Advanced)
Item Types: MCQ (4 options), numeric fill-in-blank (calculator disabled), True/False
Time Limits: 60 seconds per Math item, 90 seconds per Reading item, 45 seconds per Reasoning item. Total: 15–20 minutes.
UI Requirements:
• Clean, distraction-free assessment interface
• Question number and progress bar at top
• Timer visible but not anxiety-inducing (no colour change until 10 seconds left)
• "Skip" button available (skipped items scored as incorrect for IRT estimation)
• AI voice reads each question aloud (toggle-able by student)
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: IRT engine converges (SE < 0.3) within 20 items for 80% of students
• AC2: Item selection is demonstrably adaptive (observed difficulty tracks student ability)
• AC3: Assessment completes in 15–20 minutes
• AC4: Results show per-subject placement: "Math: Grade 3 level, Reading: Grade 2 level, Reasoning: Grade 4 level"
• AC5: Full item-response data stored for future psychometric analysis
• AC6: Parent sees summary: "Learning Level: [X]" + "Recommended starting point: [grade/subject details]"

LLM (LLaMA 3.3 70B via vLLM) generates lesson content
Content passes through safety pipeline (BS-AIE-004-F)
Content is rendered in the student UI:
◦ Ages 3–6: AI character narrates (TTS), screen shows illustrations + keywords. Text is minimal. Student listens and watches.
◦ Ages 6–12: Text displayed in scrollable cards with illustrations. AI narrates simultaneously (synchronised word highlighting). Student can pause, replay, adjust speed.
Model Configuration:
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Lesson generates in under 5 seconds end-to-end (prompt → LLM → safety check → TTS → render)
• AC2: Level 1 lessons use measurably simpler vocabulary than Level 3 (Flesch-Kincaid readability difference ≥ 2 grade levels)
• AC3: All examples are India-contextual (Indian names, ₹ currency, Indian foods, Indian sports/festivals)
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.

• AC5: Lesson content aligns with CBSE curriculum for the specified concept (verified by RAG sources cited)
• AC6: Content passes safety pipeline with zero unsafe content
BS-AIE-002-F | AI Teacher — Interactive Tutoring Conversation
Enhanced Requirements (v2.1):• This requirement SHALL define explicit failure handling and graceful degradation paths.• A single authoritative source of truth SHALL be designated for all critical state.• All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be explainable and auditable.• Anti-gaming and abuse-resistance controls SHALL be enforced.• Observability (metrics, logs, alerts) SHALL cover success, failure, and degradation paths.• Cognitive load limits SHALL be enforced as per age group.
Priority: P0
Description: During any lesson, the student can ask questions via voice or text. The AI responds conversationally using Socratic method for conceptual questions.
Flow:
Persistent microphone/keyboard icon visible during all lesson and practice screens
Student taps mic → recording indicator shown → student speaks → release to send
Voice → Whisper STT → text transcript displayed
Alternatively, students ages 6+ can type in a text input field
AI processes the question:
◦ If conceptual (e.g., "Why does this work?"): Socratic response — ask a guiding question back
◦ If factual (e.g., "What is 7x8?"): Provide the answer with brief explanation
◦ If off-topic (e.g., "Tell me a joke"): Gentle redirect: "Ha! Let's finish learning about [concept] first, then we can take a fun break!"
◦ If unsafe (detected by Llama Guard): Block + redirect: "Let's focus on our lesson!"
Conversation context: Last 10 turns are included in the LLM prompt for continuity

Priority: P0
Description: When a student achieves < 3 stars, the AI reteaches using a fundamentally different approach, not repeating the same lesson.
Strategy Pool:
Algorithm:
After star rating < 3, system checks which strategies have been tried for this student-concept pair
Select next untried strategy. Priority order varies by student profile:
◦ Level 1, ages 3–6: S1 → S5 → S2 → S4 → S6
◦ Level 1, ages 6–12: S3 → S2 → S4 → S1 → S5 → S6
◦ Level 2: S3 → S2 → S1 → S7 → S6
◦ Level 3: S7 → S2 → S3 → S6
Generate new lesson with selected strategy's prompt template
Student completes reteaching → new practice questions (different from first set) → re-score
If still < 3 stars: Try next strategy. If all strategies exhausted (max 5 attempts): Flag for mentor intervention.
Data Captured:
Table: reteaching_log
- log_id: UUID PK
- student_id: UUID FK
- concept_id: UUID FK

Priority: P0
Description: Calculate 1–5 star rating based on practice question performance. Phase 1 uses a simple percentage-based calculation (self-explanation weighting added in Phase 2).
Calculation:
percentage_correct = (correct_answers / total_questions) × 100
Stars:
0–20% → 1 star
21–40% → 2 stars
41–60% → 3 stars (MINIMUM PASS)
61–80% → 4 stars
81–100% → 5 stars
Display:
• Animated star-filling sequence (each star fills from left to right, gold colour)
• Stars 1–2: Encouraging message: "You're learning! Let's try a different way to understand this."
• Star 3: Celebration: "You did it! ⭐⭐⭐ You understand [concept]!"
• Stars 4–5: Big celebration: "Amazing! You really know this! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
• Star count added to student's total_stars counter
Database Table: concept_mastery
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Star rating calculated and displayed within 2 seconds
• AC2: Star animation plays fully (1.5 seconds for full sequence)
• AC3: If < 3 stars: System immediately transitions to reteaching (BS-AIE-003-F)
• AC4: If ≥ 3 stars: Next concept is unlocked in the learning path
• AC5: Star count in student dashboard updates in real-time

Priority: P0
Description: Students CANNOT access the next concept in the learning path until achieving ≥ 3 stars on the current concept. Enforced both client-side (UI lock) and server-side (API rejection).
Behaviour:
• Locked concepts show a lock icon and greyed-out appearance
• Tapping a locked concept: Friendly tooltip "Earn 3 stars in [Current Concept] to unlock this!"
• Unlocking animation: Lock breaks open + star burst when 3 stars achieved
• Student CAN navigate back to already-mastered concepts (for review)
• Student CAN switch to a different subject (not locked across subjects)
Server Enforcement:
GET /api/v1/lessons/:concept_id
→ Check: Do all prerequisite concepts have star_rating >= 3 in concept_mastery?
→ If yes: Return lesson content
→ If no: Return 403 { "error": "prerequisites_not_met", "missing": ["concept_uuid_1"] }
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Locked state is enforced at API level — cannot be bypassed by modifying the client
• AC2: Lock/unlock state syncs within 2 seconds of star rating change
• AC3: Subject-switching is unrestricted (student stuck in Math can do English)
• AC4: Unlock animation is satisfying and motivating (user-tested with children)

Anti-Parroting Detection:
Embed student's explanation using multilingual-e5-large
Embed the original lesson text delivered to this student
Compute cosine similarity
If similarity > 0.85: Own Words dimension score = 0, flag as "parroted"
Additional check: Extract key noun phrases from student explanation and lesson; if > 70% overlap with identical phrasing → flag
LLM Evaluation Prompt:
System: You are an expert educational assessor for Indian children.
Evaluate the student's explanation of a concept.
Student profile:
- Age: [age], Grade: [grade], IQ Level: [level]
- Language of explanation: [language]
Concept being explained: [concept_name]
Concept definition (from curriculum): [rag_content]
Learning objectives: [objectives_list]
Lesson text that was delivered to this student: [lesson_text]
Student's explanation: "[explanation_text]"
Evaluate on these 5 dimensions (each 0-100):
1. Accuracy: Are the core facts correct?
2. Completeness: Are all learning objectives addressed?
3. Own Words: Is this genuinely their own understanding? Compare to lesson text.
4. Logical Structure: Is the explanation coherent and organised?
5. Example Quality: Are examples relevant and original?

BS-CMP-003-F | Weighted Star Rating (Phase 2 Formula)
Priority: P0
Description: Upgrade the Phase 1 simple percentage-based star rating to the full weighted formula incorporating self-explanation scores.
Phase 2 Star Calculation:
weighted_total = (practice_score × 0.30) + (comprehension_score × 0.40) + (application_score × 0.20) + (retention_score × 0.10)
Where:
- practice_score = percentage correct on practice questions (0-100)
- comprehension_score = best total_score from self-explanation evaluation (0-100)
- application_score = score on application-level questions (novel problems) (0-100)
→ Phase 2: Uses top 3 Hard/Expert practice question scores as proxy
- retention_score = average star rating on this concept from spaced repetition reviews (0-100)
→ First assessment: defaults to practice_score (no reviews yet)
Stars:
0–20 → 1 star
21–40 → 2 stars
41–60 → 3 stars (MINIMUM PASS)
61–80 → 4 stars
81–100 → 5 stars
Migration from Phase 1:
• All existing concept_mastery records retain their Phase 1 star ratings
• On next review (spaced repetition), the Phase 2 formula kicks in
• No retroactive recalculation — stars can only improve or degrade through new assessments
Database Changes (concept_mastery table — additions):
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Star rating reflects all 4 components — verified by test case where high practice but low comprehension yields lower stars than Phase 1
• AC2: Phase 1 students' existing stars are preserved until next assessment
• AC3: Weighted calculation executes < 500ms
• AC4: Star display animation remains the same (visual consistency)
4.2 MODULE: MICHEL THOMAS LANGUAGE ENGINE (LNG)
BS-LNG-001-F | Language Course Structure and Building Blocks
Priority: P0
Description: Each language pair has a structured course of building blocks that teaches conversational fluency using Michel Thomas principles: zero memorisation, building blocks, audio-first, teacher responsibility.
Phase 2 Language Pairs:
Building Block Structure:
Each building block is a self-contained micro-lesson (3–5 minutes):
Introduction (30s): AI says in L1: "Let me teach you something new. Listen carefully. Don't try to remember — just understand."
Presentation (60s): AI speaks the new block in target language. Repeats 2x with L1 bridge. Example: "In Hindi, when you want to say 'I need', you say 'Mujhe chahiye'. Mujhe chahiye. Listen again: Mujhe chahiye."
Comprehension Check (30s): "What does 'Mujhe chahiye' mean?" → Student answers in L1 (voice or tap correct option)
Production Prompt (60s): "Now you try. How would you say 'I need'?" → Student speaks → AI evaluates pronunciation
Combination (60s): "Now let's build. You know 'paani' means water. How would you say 'I need water'?" → Student combines blocks
Interleaving (60s): AI mixes in 1–2 previously learned blocks: "And how would you say 'I need food'?" (using earlier block 'khaana')
Database Table: language_building_blocks
Database Table: language_courses
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Each building block micro-lesson completes in 3–5 minutes
• AC2: Zero text on screen for Stage 1 (Listening) and Stage 2 (Speaking Blocks) — everything is audio
• AC3: AI NEVER says "remember this" or "memorise" — validated by prompt review
• AC4: Previously learned blocks are naturally woven into new block lessons (interleaving)
• AC5: All 8 language pairs have at least 20 published blocks at Phase 2 launch
BS-LNG-002-F | Pronunciation Feedback Engine
Priority: P0
Description: When student speaks in the target language, AI provides real-time pronunciation feedback by comparing phoneme sequences against reference audio.
Technical Flow:
Student speaks the target phrase
Audio → Whisper Large (cloud) → phoneme-level transcription with timestamps
Reference phonemes for the phrase are retrieved from building block record
Phoneme comparison:
◦ Match each student phoneme against reference phoneme sequence
◦ Compute phoneme-level accuracy score (0–100%)
◦ Identify specific mispronounced phonemes
Feedback to student:
◦ Score ≥ 80%: "Bahut achha! That sounded great!" (encouraging, move on)
◦ Score 50–79%: "Good try! Listen to this part again: [AI replays specific segment]. Now try again." (targeted replay)
◦ Score < 50%: "Let me say it slowly for you: [AI speaks phrase at 0.7x speed, word by word]. Your turn!"
Maximum 3 pronunciation attempts per phrase before moving on
Pronunciation Scoring:
phoneme_accuracy = matched_phonemes / total_reference_phonemes × 100
stress_accuracy = correct_stress_positions / total_stress_positions × 100
overall_pronunciation = (phoneme_accuracy × 0.7) + (stress_accuracy × 0.3)
Database Table: pronunciation_attempts
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Pronunciation feedback returned within 2 seconds
• AC2: Phoneme analysis handles Indian-accented speech (trained on Indian speaker corpus)
• AC3: Feedback is specific (not generic "try again") — identifies the exact syllable or sound to improve
• AC4: Ages 3–8: Only positive and encouraging feedback — no "wrong" language
• AC5: Works for Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu phoneme sets
BS-LNG-003-F | Language Fluency Assessment (5-Star Scale)
Priority: P1
Description: Periodic fluency assessments measure conversational ability on a 5-star scale, separate from academic concept stars.
Assessment Structure (every 10 blocks):
Comprehension Test (2 min): AI speaks 5 sentences in target language. Student identifies meaning (MCQ in L1). Tests listening comprehension.
Production Test (3 min): AI prompts 5 situations in L1, student responds in target language. E.g., "Ask for a glass of water" → Student speaks in Hindi.
Conversation Simulation (3 min): AI conducts a short roleplay conversation (ordering at a shop, introducing family). Evaluated for: vocabulary range, grammatical structure, fluency (hesitation count), pronunciation.
Scoring → Star Rating:
Database Table: language_fluency_assessments
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Assessment takes 8–10 minutes total
• AC2: Conversation simulation feels natural (AI responds contextually, not scripted)

BS-SPC-001-F | Intensive Phase Pacing Engine
Priority: P0
Description: During the 4-month intensive phase, the system calculates a personalised daily learning pace to complete the year's curriculum in 16 weeks.
Pacing Calculation:
total_concepts = count_concepts(student.board, student.grade, student.subjects)
available_days = 112 - holidays(student.state) - buffer_days(7)
daily_target = ceil(total_concepts / available_days)
Adjusted by IQ Level:
Level 3: daily_target × 1.3 (3-4 concepts/day typical)
Level 2: daily_target × 1.0 (2-3 concepts/day typical)
Level 1: daily_target × 0.7 (1-2 concepts/day typical)
Weekly Milestone Checks (Every Friday):
Calculate: expected_concepts_completed = daily_target × days_elapsed
Compare to actual_concepts_completed
If behind by > 20%:
◦ Push notification to parent: "[Child] is a bit behind schedule. Encouraging 15 extra minutes of learning this week could help!"
◦ AI adjusts: Slightly increase pace for next week, prioritise high-weight concepts
If ahead by > 20%:
◦ Celebrate: "Amazing progress! [Child] is ahead of schedule!"
◦ AI offers: Enrichment activities, deeper dives, or preview of next grade topics
If exactly on track: "Perfect pace! Keep going!"

BS-SPC-002-F | Spaced Repetition Review Scheduler
Priority: P0
Description: After a concept reaches 3+ stars and the student enters the spaced repetition phase, the system schedules periodic reviews at increasing intervals using a modified Leitner algorithm.
Algorithm — Modified Leitner with Star-Based Intervals:
On concept reaching 3+ stars:
next_review = calculate_interval(star_rating)
Interval Table:
5★: Review at +14 days, +30 days, +60 days, +120 days
4★: Review at +7 days, +14 days, +30 days, +60 days
3★: Review at +3 days, +7 days, +14 days, +30 days, +60 days
On each review:
Student answers 2-3 questions + brief self-explanation (30-second minimum)
Star rating recalculated using Phase 2 weighted formula
If new_stars >= previous_stars:
Move to next interval level (longer gap)
If new_stars < 3:
IMMEDIATELY re-enter intensive mode for this concept
Reteaching triggered (BS-AIE-003-F)
If 5★ maintained for 3 consecutive reviews:
Move to 4-month maintenance cycle
Daily Review Queue Generation:
• Runs at midnight (student's timezone) or on app open
• Selects 5–10 concepts where next_review_date <= today
• Composition: 70% scheduled reviews + 30% interleaved (random concepts from other subjects to promote cross-topic connections)
• Prioritised: Overdue reviews first, then by star rating (lower stars = higher priority)
• Estimated time: 15–25 minutes for daily review

BS-GAM-003-F | Story Mode — Journey with Hanuman
Priority: P1
Description: An overarching narrative adventure where learning activities are quests. Indian mythology-themed, making learning feel like an epic journey.
Narrative Structure:
The student joins young Hanuman on a quest to find the fragments of a magical scroll of knowledge scattered across Bharatvarsha. Each subject represents a different land, each chapter a new village, and each concept a quest within that village.
Chapter Mapping:
Math land → Aryabhatta's Kingdom (concepts = quests to solve mathematical challenges)
Science land → Vaisheshika Valley (concepts = experiments to understand nature)
English land → Saraswati's Library (concepts = stories to unlock)
Hindi land → Devanagari Dham (concepts = conversations to master)
Progression:
• Completing a concept = completing a quest → narrative scene unlocks (2–3 sentences + illustration)
• Earning 5 stars = bonus narrative scene with a "treasure" (extra story detail)
• Every 10 concepts = a "chapter finale" with a short animated scene (30–60 seconds)
• Story is delivered in student's Language 1
Implementation (Phase 2 — MVP):
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.
• Pre-written narrative scenes (200 scenes for 200 base concepts, expandable)
• Static illustrations per scene (AI-generated artwork, culturally Indian)
• Story progress tracked separately from academic progress
• Story mode is opt-in from student dashboard ("Continue your adventure →")
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Story narrative loads within 1 second of concept completion
• AC2: All narrative content is culturally appropriate and Indian mythology-themed
• AC3: Story progress persists and continues from where the student left off
• AC4: Story mode does NOT block academic progress (it's a reward layer)
• AC5: Ages 3–6: Story is narrated via TTS; ages 6+: displayed as text + narration
BS-GAM-004-F | Streak Freezes and Enhanced Streaks
Priority: P2
Description: Streak freezes protect a student's streak on days they can't learn. Freezes are earned through consistent learning, never purchased.
Earning Streak Freezes:
• 7-day streak → earn 1 freeze
• 14-day streak → earn 1 additional freeze
• 30-day streak → earn 2 additional freezes
• Maximum stored: 5 freezes
Using Streak Freezes:
• If student does not complete a learning day, system auto-applies a freeze at midnight (if available)
• Streak counter shows ❄️ icon for frozen days
• Parent is notified: "[Child] used a streak freeze today. Streak maintained at [X] days."
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Freeze auto-applied at midnight if no learning activity detected
• AC2: Streak freeze balance visible in student dashboard
• AC3: Freeze is consumed even if student does a small activity below the threshold (learning day = 1 concept OR 10 questions; if not met, freeze is used if available)

Priority: P0
Description: Before ANY child data is collected, the parent MUST read and explicitly consent to data processing per the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. Consent must be verifiable — the system records what was shown, when, and how consent was confirmed.
Trigger: When parent taps "Add Child" for the first time (before the child profile form appears).
Input Flow:
System displays a full-screen Consent Notice in the parent's preferred language
Consent Notice contents (mandatory per DPDP Act Section 6):
◦ What data we collect: Child's first name, date of birth, voice recordings during lessons, learning progress data, question responses, time-on-platform data
◦ Why we collect it: To deliver personalised AI-driven education to your child
◦ How it is used: Data is processed by AI models to adapt teaching to your child's learning level. Data is never used for advertising. Data is never sold to third parties.
◦ Who has access: You (the parent), your child's assigned mentor (if applicable), and BabySteps system administrators for technical support
◦ How long we keep it: Learning data is kept for the duration of enrollment + 1 year. Voice recordings are processed and auto-deleted within 30 days unless you choose to retain them.
◦ Your rights: You can withdraw consent at any time. You can request a copy of all data. You can request deletion of all data. Contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@babysteps.in
Parent must scroll to the bottom of the notice (scroll tracking confirms full read)
Checkbox: "I, [auto-filled parent name], give consent for BabySteps to process my child's personal data as described above"
Checkbox is unchecked by default — parent must actively check it
"I Agree" button (disabled until checkbox is checked AND full scroll confirmed)
Identity Verification — one of:
◦ Method A (preferred): Aadhaar + OTP via DigiLocker — System redirects to DigiLocker OAuth. Parent authenticates. DigiLocker returns verified name + masked Aadhaar. System records DigiLocker verification ID.
◦ Method B: Virtual ID — Parent enters Aadhaar Virtual ID + OTP sent to Aadhaar-linked mobile
◦ Method C: Credit/debit card micro-charge — ₹1 charge to parent's card (refunded) confirms identity via card holder name match. For parents without Aadhaar.
On successful verification: Consent record created (immutable), child profile form is displayed

Description: Children aged 3–6 log in by tapping their avatar, then selecting 3 pictures in sequence from a grid.
Setup Flow (during profile creation):
System displays instruction to parent: "Help your child choose 3 secret pictures"
A 4×3 grid of 12 pictures is displayed (large tiles 80×80dp): Lotus, Mango, Peacock, Elephant, Cricket Bat, Sun, Moon, Star, Fish, Butterfly, Cow, Train
Parent and child together tap 3 pictures in their chosen order
System confirms: "Your secret pictures are: [Pic1] → [Pic2] → [Pic3]. Remember this!"
Sequence is hashed (bcrypt) and stored
Login Flow:
App home screen shows all student avatars registered on this device (large cards with display name + avatar image, voice narration of name)
Child taps their avatar → voice says "Hello [Display Name]! Tap your secret pictures!"
Same 4×3 grid appears. Pictures are in RANDOMISED positions (different from setup)
Child taps 3 pictures in the correct sequence
Each tap: Picture bounces + sparkle animation + pleasant sound
If correct: Confetti animation + "Welcome back, [Name]!" + redirect to dashboard
If wrong: Friendly wobble animation + "Oops, let's try again!" + grid re-randomises
After 5 wrong attempts: "Let's get a grown-up to help!" + Parent unlock screen (parent enters OTP or device PIN)
Successful login creates a session (JWT, 24-hour expiry)
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Grid randomises picture positions on every login attempt (prevents positional memory)
• AC2: All interactions work without any text reading by the child
• AC3: Audio feedback accompanies every action
• AC4: Login completes in under 15 seconds for a child who knows their pictures
• AC5: Works on 4-inch screens (grid adapts to screen size)
• AC6: Parent can reset secret pictures from parent app
• AC7: After 5 failures, device locks for 5 minutes for that student (parent override available)

Description: Students aged 6–12 log in by tapping their avatar, then entering a 4-digit PIN on a numeric keypad.
Setup Flow: Parent sets the 4-digit PIN during profile creation. Student is shown the PIN and asked to enter it once to confirm.
Login Flow:
Student taps their avatar on home screen
"Hi [Name]! Enter your PIN" with a large 3×4+1 numeric keypad (1–9, 0, backspace, enter)
Each digit entered shows a filled dot (●) — PIN is masked
On 4th digit: auto-submit (no need to tap Enter)
If correct: Welcome animation + dashboard
If wrong: Shake + "Try again!" + allow 5 attempts
After 5 failures: Parent unlock required
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Keypad buttons are minimum 56×56dp with 8dp spacing
• AC2: PIN is never displayed on screen (always masked)
• AC3: PIN hash is bcrypt (cost 12), never stored in plain text
• AC4: Parent can reset PIN from parent dashboard (triggers OTP to parent's phone)
• AC5: Auto-submit on 4th digit reduces friction

Description: Every API request is authorised against the user's role and data scope. Enforced at both API middleware and database (row-level security) layers.
Phase 1 Roles:
Enforcement Logic (every API request):
Extract JWT from Authorization: Bearer <token> header
Validate JWT: Check signature (RS256), expiry, issuer
Extract claims: sub (user_id), role, iat, exp
API middleware checks: Is this role allowed to call this endpoint? (whitelist per role)
If endpoint is allowed, inject scope predicate into database query:
◦ Student calling GET /progress → SELECT * FROM concept_mastery WHERE student_id = $jwt.sub
◦ Parent calling GET /children/:id/progress → SELECT * FROM concept_mastery WHERE student_id = $child_id AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM students WHERE student_id = $child_id AND parent_id = $jwt.sub)
If role check fails: Return HTTP 403 + log to audit_log
If scope check fails (e.g., parent trying to access unlinked child): Return HTTP 403 + log to audit_log
Database Table: audit_log (APPEND-ONLY, partitioned by month)
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Student A's JWT CANNOT retrieve Student B's data — verified via automated penetration test
• AC2: Parent can ONLY access their own linked children — cross-parent access blocked
• AC3: Every denied request is logged with full context
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.
• AC4: JWT with expired token returns 401 (not 403)
• AC5: Audit log table cannot be modified via application code (enforced by DB permissions)

Description: An interactive, game-like diagnostic assessment determines the child's initial IQ Level. Entirely voice-and-touch-based with no reading required.
Structure: 15 tasks across 4 domains
Domain 1: Pattern Recognition (5 tasks)
Domain 2: Vocabulary (4 tasks) — AI voice speaks in Language 1 (Hindi/English)
Domain 3: Numeracy (4 tasks)
Domain 4: Instruction Following (2 tasks)
Adaptive Logic:
• Tasks presented in order above (easy → hard within each domain)
• If child gets tasks 1–2 wrong in a domain, skip remaining hard tasks in that domain (move to next domain)
• Total time: 8–12 minutes with generous 30-second timeout per task
IQ Level Calculation:
UI Requirements:
• Every task has AI voice narration in Language 1
• Answer options are large tappable tiles (minimum 80×80dp)
• Correct answer: Star burst animation + "Yay!" sound (regardless of answer — no negative feedback)
• Wrong answer: Same positive animation (child doesn't know they got it wrong)
• Progress: 15 dots at bottom of screen, filling as tasks complete
• "Take a break" option (parent can pause and resume within 24 hours)
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Assessment completes in 8–12 minutes
• AC2: ZERO text appears on any task screen — everything is visual + audio
• AC3: All audio is in child's Language 1 (Hindi or English for Phase 1)
• AC4: Result is shown to parent as "Your child's Learning Level: [Foundation/Standard/Advanced]" — the word "IQ" is NEVER shown to parents or children
• AC5: Result is stored in student record and learning path adapts immediately
• AC6: If child abandons mid-assessment, progress is saved and they can resume within 24 hours

Description: Adaptive diagnostic using Item Response Theory (IRT) to assess Math, Reading, and Logical Reasoning abilities and assign IQ Level.
Structure: 25 items, adaptive difficulty
Item Pool (minimum for Phase 1):
• Math: 50 calibrated items across Easy/Medium/Hard (addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, word problems for Grades 1–5)
• Reading Comprehension: 30 calibrated items (passage-based questions in Hindi and English)
• Logical Reasoning: 20 calibrated items (sequences, odd-one-out, analogies)
IRT 3PL Adaptive Algorithm:
Start with a medium-difficulty item (b = 0.0)
After student responds, update ability estimate (θ) using Bayesian updating
Select next item that maximises Fisher information at current θ estimate
Repeat until: Standard Error of θ < 0.30 OR 25 items administered
Final θ estimate determines IQ Level:
◦ θ < -0.5 → Level 1 (Foundation)
◦ -0.5 ≤ θ ≤ +0.5 → Level 2 (Standard)
◦ θ > +0.5 → Level 3 (Advanced)
Item Types: MCQ (4 options), numeric fill-in-blank (calculator disabled), True/False
Time Limits: 60 seconds per Math item, 90 seconds per Reading item, 45 seconds per Reasoning item. Total: 15–20 minutes.
UI Requirements:
• Clean, distraction-free assessment interface
• Question number and progress bar at top
• Timer visible but not anxiety-inducing (no colour change until 10 seconds left)
• "Skip" button available (skipped items scored as incorrect for IRT estimation)
• AI voice reads each question aloud (toggle-able by student)
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: IRT engine converges (SE < 0.3) within 20 items for 80% of students
• AC2: Item selection is demonstrably adaptive (observed difficulty tracks student ability)
• AC3: Assessment completes in 15–20 minutes
• AC4: Results show per-subject placement: "Math: Grade 3 level, Reading: Grade 2 level, Reasoning: Grade 4 level"
• AC5: Full item-response data stored for future psychometric analysis
• AC6: Parent sees summary: "Learning Level: [X]" + "Recommended starting point: [grade/subject details]"

Description: For every concept in the learning path, the AI Teacher generates a personalised lesson adapted to the student's IQ Level, delivering it via text + TTS narration.
Flow:
Student's dashboard shows the next unlocked concept. Student taps to start.
System retrieves: concept metadata (from concepts table), curriculum content chunks (from RAG vector DB), student's IQ Level, student's age group, student's Language 1, student's performance on prerequisite concepts
System constructs an LLM prompt:
System: You are a warm, patient AI teacher for Indian children.
The student is [age] years old, in [grade], studying [subject] at [IQ Level] level.
Their language is [Language 1]. They have mastered the following prerequisites: [list].
Teaching style for [IQ Level]:
- Level 1: Use very simple words. Give 5-7 examples from Indian daily life (buying vegetables at sabzi mandi, sharing rotis, counting cricket runs). Go step by step. Use analogies. Be very encouraging.
- Level 2: Use clear explanations with 3-4 examples. Balance simplicity with mild challenge.
- Level 3: Be concise. Provide 1-2 examples then challenge with deeper questions. Connect to other subjects.
Curriculum context (from RAG):
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.
[Retrieved curriculum chunks for this concept]

◦ Ages 6–12: Text displayed in scrollable cards with illustrations. AI narrates simultaneously (synchronised word highlighting). Student can pause, replay, adjust speed.
Model Configuration:
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Lesson generates in under 5 seconds end-to-end (prompt → LLM → safety check → TTS → render)
• AC2: Level 1 lessons use measurably simpler vocabulary than Level 3 (Flesch-Kincaid readability difference ≥ 2 grade levels)
• AC3: All examples are India-contextual (Indian names, ₹ currency, Indian foods, Indian sports/festivals)
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.

Description: During any lesson, the student can ask questions via voice or text. The AI responds conversationally using Socratic method for conceptual questions.
Flow:
Persistent microphone/keyboard icon visible during all lesson and practice screens
Student taps mic → recording indicator shown → student speaks → release to send
Voice → Whisper STT → text transcript displayed
Alternatively, students ages 6+ can type in a text input field
AI processes the question:
◦ If conceptual (e.g., "Why does this work?"): Socratic response — ask a guiding question back
◦ If factual (e.g., "What is 7x8?"): Provide the answer with brief explanation
◦ If off-topic (e.g., "Tell me a joke"): Gentle redirect: "Ha! Let's finish learning about [concept] first, then we can take a fun break!"
◦ If unsafe (detected by Llama Guard): Block + redirect: "Let's focus on our lesson!"
Conversation context: Last 10 turns are included in the LLM prompt for continuity
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.

BS-STR-002-F | Star Rating Calculation (Phase 1 — Basic)
This requirement SHALL enforce strict tenant isolation, security-by-default configuration, and operational resilience. All enterprise-grade decisions SHALL be auditable, versioned, and compliant with applicable regulations. Failure handling, disaster recovery, and graceful degradation SHALL be explicitly supported. Observability SHALL cover SLAs, SLOs, and compliance metrics. No cross-tenant data access SHALL be possible under any condition.
Priority: P0
Description: Calculate 1–5 star rating based on practice question performance. Phase 1 uses a simple percentage-based calculation (self-explanation weighting added in Phase 2).
Calculation:
percentage_correct = (correct_answers / total_questions) × 100
Stars:
0–20% → 1 star
21–40% → 2 stars
41–60% → 3 stars (MINIMUM PASS)
61–80% → 4 stars
81–100% → 5 stars
Display:
• Animated star-filling sequence (each star fills from left to right, gold colour)
• Stars 1–2: Encouraging message: "You're learning! Let's try a different way to understand this."
• Star 3: Celebration: "You did it! ⭐⭐⭐ You understand [concept]!"
• Stars 4–5: Big celebration: "Amazing! You really know this! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
• Star count added to student's total_stars counter
Database Table: concept_mastery
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Star rating calculated and displayed within 2 seconds
• AC2: Star animation plays fully (1.5 seconds for full sequence)
• AC3: If < 3 stars: System immediately transitions to reteaching (BS-AIE-003-F)
• AC4: If ≥ 3 stars: Next concept is unlocked in the learning path
• AC5: Star count in student dashboard updates in real-time

This requirement SHALL enforce strict tenant isolation, security-by-default configuration, and operational resilience. All enterprise-grade decisions SHALL be auditable, versioned, and compliant with applicable regulations. Failure handling, disaster recovery, and graceful degradation SHALL be explicitly supported. Observability SHALL cover SLAs, SLOs, and compliance metrics. No cross-tenant data access SHALL be possible under any condition.
Priority: P0
Description: Students CANNOT access the next concept in the learning path until achieving ≥ 3 stars on the current concept. Enforced both client-side (UI lock) and server-side (API rejection).
Behaviour:
• Locked concepts show a lock icon and greyed-out appearance
• Tapping a locked concept: Friendly tooltip "Earn 3 stars in [Current Concept] to unlock this!"
• Unlocking animation: Lock breaks open + star burst when 3 stars achieved
• Student CAN navigate back to already-mastered concepts (for review)
• Student CAN switch to a different subject (not locked across subjects)
Server Enforcement:
GET /api/v1/lessons/:concept_id
→ Check: Do all prerequisite concepts have star_rating >= 3 in concept_mastery?
→ If yes: Return lesson content
→ If no: Return 403 { "error": "prerequisites_not_met", "missing": ["concept_uuid_1"] }
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Locked state is enforced at API level — cannot be bypassed by modifying the client
• AC2: Lock/unlock state syncs within 2 seconds of star rating change
• AC3: Subject-switching is unrestricted (student stuck in Math can do English)
• AC4: Unlock animation is satisfying and motivating (user-tested with children)

Phase 1 Scope: ~200 concepts covering CBSE Math (Grades 1–5) and English/Hindi Language (Grades 1–5).
Example Graph Fragment (Math Grade 3):
Counting 1-100 → Addition (single digit) → Addition (double digit) → Addition (triple digit)
→ Subtraction (single digit) → Subtraction (double digit)
Counting 1-100 → Skip Counting by 2s → Multiplication concept → Times tables (2,3,4,5)
→ Skip Counting by 5s ↗
→ Skip Counting by 10s ↗
Database Tables:
Table: concepts (see BS-CUR-001 in full)
Key fields: concept_id, concept_name, subject, grade_level, board,
estimated_time_minutes, standard_codes[], difficulty_index, status
Table: concept_prerequisites
- id: UUID PK
- concept_id: UUID FK -- the concept requiring the prerequisite
- prerequisite_id: UUID FK -- the prerequisite concept
- relationship: ENUM('required','alternative') DEFAULT 'required'
- alt_group: INTEGER -- for OR-logic grouping
Learning Path Computation:
def get_next_concepts(student_id):
mastered = get_mastered_concepts(student_id)  # all with stars >= 3
all_concepts = get_curriculum_concepts(student.board, student.grade)
unlocked = []
for concept in all_concepts:
if concept.id in mastered:
continue  # already done
prereqs = get_prerequisites(concept.id)
required = [p for p in prereqs if p.relationship == 'required']
alternatives = group_by(prereqs, 'alt_group')
all_required_met = all(p.prerequisite_id in mastered for p in required)
all_alt_groups_met = all(
any(p.prerequisite_id in mastered for p in group)
for group in alternatives.values()
)
if all_required_met and all_alt_groups_met:
unlocked.append(concept)
return sort_by_curriculum_sequence(unlocked)
Acceptance Criteria:

Student learns languages via Michel Thomas Method — audio-first building blocks, pronunciation feedback, conversational practice
Student earns badges, coins, and progresses through a Story Mode adventure narrative
Spaced repetition engine schedules daily reviews of mastered concepts — stars can drop and trigger reteaching
Student in Grades 6–10 has access to Science and Social Studies
Mentor can review student progress, spot-check explanations, schedule video calls, and communicate with parents
Parent sees comprehension quality trends, AI-generated insights, and weekly narrative reports
Premium subscribers get mentor access, advanced analytics, and family plan for up to 5 children
Scholarship applicants can apply through the in-app portal

Evaluation Dimensions:
Anti-Parroting Detection:
Embed student's explanation using multilingual-e5-large
Embed the original lesson text delivered to this student
Compute cosine similarity
If similarity > 0.85: Own Words dimension score = 0, flag as "parroted"
Additional check: Extract key noun phrases from student explanation and lesson; if > 70% overlap with identical phrasing → flag
LLM Evaluation Prompt:
System: You are an expert educational assessor for Indian children.
Evaluate the student's explanation of a concept.
Student profile:
- Age: [age], Grade: [grade], IQ Level: [level]
- Language of explanation: [language]
Concept being explained: [concept_name]
Concept definition (from curriculum): [rag_content]
Learning objectives: [objectives_list]
Lesson text that was delivered to this student: [lesson_text]
Student's explanation: "[explanation_text]"
Evaluate on these 5 dimensions (each 0-100):
1. Accuracy: Are the core facts correct?
2. Completeness: Are all learning objectives addressed?
3. Own Words: Is this genuinely their own understanding? Compare to lesson text.
4. Logical Structure: Is the explanation coherent and organised?
5. Example Quality: Are examples relevant and original?

BS-CMP-003-F | Weighted Star Rating (Phase 2 Formula)
This requirement SHALL enforce strict tenant isolation, security-by-default configuration, and operational resilience. All enterprise-grade decisions SHALL be auditable, versioned, and compliant with applicable regulations. Failure handling, disaster recovery, and graceful degradation SHALL be explicitly supported. Observability SHALL cover SLAs, SLOs, and compliance metrics. No cross-tenant data access SHALL be possible under any condition.
This requirement SHALL include explicit failure handling, authoritative source-of-truth definition, AI explainability, anti-gaming controls, observability (metrics, logs, alerts), and age-appropriate cognitive load enforcement. All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be auditable.
Priority: P0
Description: Upgrade the Phase 1 simple percentage-based star rating to the full weighted formula incorporating self-explanation scores.
Phase 2 Star Calculation:
weighted_total = (practice_score × 0.30) + (comprehension_score × 0.40) + (application_score × 0.20) + (retention_score × 0.10)
Where:
- practice_score = percentage correct on practice questions (0-100)
- comprehension_score = best total_score from self-explanation evaluation (0-100)
- application_score = score on application-level questions (novel problems) (0-100)
→ Phase 2: Uses top 3 Hard/Expert practice question scores as proxy
- retention_score = average star rating on this concept from spaced repetition reviews (0-100)
→ First assessment: defaults to practice_score (no reviews yet)
Stars:
0–20 → 1 star
21–40 → 2 stars
41–60 → 3 stars (MINIMUM PASS)
61–80 → 4 stars
81–100 → 5 stars
Migration from Phase 1:
• All existing concept_mastery records retain their Phase 1 star ratings
• On next review (spaced repetition), the Phase 2 formula kicks in
• No retroactive recalculation — stars can only improve or degrade through new assessments
Database Changes (concept_mastery table — additions):
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Star rating reflects all 4 components — verified by test case where high practice but low comprehension yields lower stars than Phase 1
• AC2: Phase 1 students' existing stars are preserved until next assessment
• AC3: Weighted calculation executes < 500ms
• AC4: Star display animation remains the same (visual consistency)
4.2 MODULE: MICHEL THOMAS LANGUAGE ENGINE (LNG)
BS-LNG-001-F | Language Course Structure and Building Blocks
This requirement SHALL enforce strict tenant isolation, security-by-default configuration, and operational resilience. All enterprise-grade decisions SHALL be auditable, versioned, and compliant with applicable regulations. Failure handling, disaster recovery, and graceful degradation SHALL be explicitly supported. Observability SHALL cover SLAs, SLOs, and compliance metrics. No cross-tenant data access SHALL be possible under any condition.
This requirement SHALL include explicit failure handling, authoritative source-of-truth definition, AI explainability, anti-gaming controls, observability (metrics, logs, alerts), and age-appropriate cognitive load enforcement. All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be auditable.
Priority: P0
Description: Each language pair has a structured course of building blocks that teaches conversational fluency using Michel Thomas principles: zero memorisation, building blocks, audio-first, teacher responsibility.
Phase 2 Language Pairs:
Building Block Structure:
Each building block is a self-contained micro-lesson (3–5 minutes):
Introduction (30s): AI says in L1: "Let me teach you something new. Listen carefully. Don't try to remember — just understand."
Presentation (60s): AI speaks the new block in target language. Repeats 2x with L1 bridge. Example: "In Hindi, when you want to say 'I need', you say 'Mujhe chahiye'. Mujhe chahiye. Listen again: Mujhe chahiye."
Comprehension Check (30s): "What does 'Mujhe chahiye' mean?" → Student answers in L1 (voice or tap correct option)
Production Prompt (60s): "Now you try. How would you say 'I need'?" → Student speaks → AI evaluates pronunciation
Combination (60s): "Now let's build. You know 'paani' means water. How would you say 'I need water'?" → Student combines blocks
Interleaving (60s): AI mixes in 1–2 previously learned blocks: "And how would you say 'I need food'?" (using earlier block 'khaana')
Database Table: language_building_blocks
Database Table: language_courses
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Each building block micro-lesson completes in 3–5 minutes
• AC2: Zero text on screen for Stage 1 (Listening) and Stage 2 (Speaking Blocks) — everything is audio
• AC3: AI NEVER says "remember this" or "memorise" — validated by prompt review
• AC4: Previously learned blocks are naturally woven into new block lessons (interleaving)
• AC5: All 8 language pairs have at least 20 published blocks at Phase 2 launch
BS-LNG-002-F | Pronunciation Feedback Engine
This requirement SHALL enforce strict tenant isolation, security-by-default configuration, and operational resilience. All enterprise-grade decisions SHALL be auditable, versioned, and compliant with applicable regulations. Failure handling, disaster recovery, and graceful degradation SHALL be explicitly supported.

This requirement SHALL include explicit failure handling, authoritative source-of-truth definition, AI explainability, anti-gaming controls, observability (metrics, logs, alerts), and age-appropriate cognitive load enforcement. All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be auditable.
Priority: P0
Description: When student speaks in the target language, AI provides real-time pronunciation feedback by comparing phoneme sequences against reference audio.
Technical Flow:
Student speaks the target phrase
Audio → Whisper Large (cloud) → phoneme-level transcription with timestamps
Reference phonemes for the phrase are retrieved from building block record
Phoneme comparison:
◦ Match each student phoneme against reference phoneme sequence
◦ Compute phoneme-level accuracy score (0–100%)
◦ Identify specific mispronounced phonemes
Feedback to student:
◦ Score ≥ 80%: "Bahut achha! That sounded great!" (encouraging, move on)
◦ Score 50–79%: "Good try! Listen to this part again: [AI replays specific segment]. Now try again." (targeted replay)
◦ Score < 50%: "Let me say it slowly for you: [AI speaks phrase at 0.7x speed, word by word]. Your turn!"
Maximum 3 pronunciation attempts per phrase before moving on
Pronunciation Scoring:
phoneme_accuracy = matched_phonemes / total_reference_phonemes × 100
stress_accuracy = correct_stress_positions / total_stress_positions × 100
overall_pronunciation = (phoneme_accuracy × 0.7) + (stress_accuracy × 0.3)
Database Table: pronunciation_attempts
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Pronunciation feedback returned within 2 seconds
• AC2: Phoneme analysis handles Indian-accented speech (trained on Indian speaker corpus)
• AC3: Feedback is specific (not generic "try again") — identifies the exact syllable or sound to improve
• AC4: Ages 3–8: Only positive and encouraging feedback — no "wrong" language
• AC5: Works for Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu phoneme sets

This requirement SHALL include explicit failure handling, authoritative source-of-truth definition, AI explainability, anti-gaming controls, observability (metrics, logs, alerts), and age-appropriate cognitive load enforcement. All AI-mediated decisions SHALL be auditable.
Priority: P1
Description: Periodic fluency assessments measure conversational ability on a 5-star scale, separate from academic concept stars.
Assessment Structure (every 10 blocks):
Comprehension Test (2 min): AI speaks 5 sentences in target language. Student identifies meaning (MCQ in L1). Tests listening comprehension.
Production Test (3 min): AI prompts 5 situations in L1, student responds in target language. E.g., "Ask for a glass of water" → Student speaks in Hindi.
Conversation Simulation (3 min): AI conducts a short roleplay conversation (ordering at a shop, introducing family). Evaluated for: vocabulary range, grammatical structure, fluency (hesitation count), pronunciation.
Scoring → Star Rating:
Database Table: language_fluency_assessments
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Assessment takes 8–10 minutes total
• AC2: Conversation simulation feels natural (AI responds contextually, not scripted)
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.
• AC3: Star rating is based on communicative ability, NOT grammar accuracy (per Michel Thomas philosophy)

Description: During the 4-month intensive phase, the system calculates a personalised daily learning pace to complete the year's curriculum in 16 weeks.
Pacing Calculation:
total_concepts = count_concepts(student.board, student.grade, student.subjects)
available_days = 112 - holidays(student.state) - buffer_days(7)
daily_target = ceil(total_concepts / available_days)
Adjusted by IQ Level:
Level 3: daily_target × 1.3 (3-4 concepts/day typical)
Level 2: daily_target × 1.0 (2-3 concepts/day typical)
Level 1: daily_target × 0.7 (1-2 concepts/day typical)
Weekly Milestone Checks (Every Friday):
Calculate: expected_concepts_completed = daily_target × days_elapsed
Compare to actual_concepts_completed
If behind by > 20%:
◦ Push notification to parent: "[Child] is a bit behind schedule. Encouraging 15 extra minutes of learning this week could help!"
◦ AI adjusts: Slightly increase pace for next week, prioritise high-weight concepts
If ahead by > 20%:
◦ Celebrate: "Amazing progress! [Child] is ahead of schedule!"
◦ AI offers: Enrichment activities, deeper dives, or preview of next grade topics
If exactly on track: "Perfect pace! Keep going!"

Priority: P0
Description: After a concept reaches 3+ stars and the student enters the spaced repetition phase, the system schedules periodic reviews at increasing intervals using a modified Leitner algorithm.
Algorithm — Modified Leitner with Star-Based Intervals:
On concept reaching 3+ stars:
next_review = calculate_interval(star_rating)
Interval Table:
5★: Review at +14 days, +30 days, +60 days, +120 days
4★: Review at +7 days, +14 days, +30 days, +60 days
3★: Review at +3 days, +7 days, +14 days, +30 days, +60 days
On each review:
Student answers 2-3 questions + brief self-explanation (30-second minimum)
Star rating recalculated using Phase 2 weighted formula
If new_stars >= previous_stars:
Move to next interval level (longer gap)
If new_stars < 3:
IMMEDIATELY re-enter intensive mode for this concept
Reteaching triggered (BS-AIE-003-F)
If 5★ maintained for 3 consecutive reviews:
Move to 4-month maintenance cycle
Daily Review Queue Generation:
• Runs at midnight (student's timezone) or on app open
• Selects 5–10 concepts where next_review_date <= today
• Composition: 70% scheduled reviews + 30% interleaved (random concepts from other subjects to promote cross-topic connections)
• Prioritised: Overdue reviews first, then by star rating (lower stars = higher priority)
• Estimated time: 15–25 minutes for daily review

Priority: P1
Description: An overarching narrative adventure where learning activities are quests. Indian mythology-themed, making learning feel like an epic journey.
Narrative Structure:
The student joins young Hanuman on a quest to find the fragments of a magical scroll of knowledge scattered across Bharatvarsha. Each subject represents a different land, each chapter a new village, and each concept a quest within that village.
Chapter Mapping:
Math land → Aryabhatta's Kingdom (concepts = quests to solve mathematical challenges)
Science land → Vaisheshika Valley (concepts = experiments to understand nature)
English land → Saraswati's Library (concepts = stories to unlock)
Hindi land → Devanagari Dham (concepts = conversations to master)
Progression:
• Completing a concept = completing a quest → narrative scene unlocks (2–3 sentences + illustration)
• Earning 5 stars = bonus narrative scene with a "treasure" (extra story detail)
• Every 10 concepts = a "chapter finale" with a short animated scene (30–60 seconds)
• Story is delivered in student's Language 1
Implementation (Phase 2 — MVP):
Technology Stack Mandate:All backend services SHALL be implemented in Python. All frontend user interfaces SHALL be implemented in React. Node.js SHALL be used for build tooling, orchestration, and supporting services only. No alternative primary languages or frameworks are permitted unless explicitly approved.
• Pre-written narrative scenes (200 scenes for 200 base concepts, expandable)
• Static illustrations per scene (AI-generated artwork, culturally Indian)
• Story progress tracked separately from academic progress
• Story mode is opt-in from student dashboard ("Continue your adventure →")
Acceptance Criteria:
• AC1: Story narrative loads within 1 second of concept completion

BS-TNT-002-F | Bulk Student Import
This requirement SHALL enforce strict tenant isolation, security-by-default configuration, and operational resilience. All enterprise-grade decisions SHALL be auditable, versioned, and compliant with applicable regulations. Failure handling, disaster recovery, and graceful degradation SHALL be explicitly supported. Observability SHALL cover SLAs, SLOs, and compliance metrics. No cross-tenant data access SHALL be possible under any condition.
Priority: P0
Description: School administrators import students, parents, and teachers in bulk via CSV or OneRoster format.
Supported Import Formats:
Import Flow:
School admin uploads CSV file (max 10,000 rows per file)
System validates: Required fields present, DOB within valid range, mobile number format, no duplicates (by parent mobile + student name)
Validation report shown: "Valid: 1,847 | Errors: 23 | Warnings: 5"
Admin reviews errors (e.g., "Row 45: DOB invalid — 2030-01-15"), can fix or skip
On confirm: Batch job creates parent accounts → sends OTP to each parent → consent flow initiated
Parent receives SMS: "Your school [School Name] has registered [Child] on BabySteps. Complete setup: babysteps.in/setup?code=XXXX"
Parent completes: OTP verification → consent → child profile enrichment (avatar, login method)
Parental Consent for Bulk Import:
