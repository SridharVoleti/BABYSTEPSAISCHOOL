Version: 1.0
1. Overview
The AI Virtual School will deliver fully virtual, gamified, AI-instructed lessons across subjects for students in Classes 1–12. Key features include AI character instructor, real-time activity monitoring using ASR and interaction tracking, gamification (XP, badges, progression), and detailed dashboards for teachers and administrators, with multi-board curriculum support.
2. Functional Modules
2.1 Student Module
2.1.1 User Management
• Student registration: email/phone, password, optional parental verification
• Profile: Name, Class, Board, Subjects, Language proficiency
• Parent-linked profile for monitoring
2.1.2 Lesson Interface
• Interactive AI lesson with TTS narration, animations, character avatar, lesson text, images, and videos
2.1.3 Learning Activities & Completion Verification
Reading Activity Example: ASR transcription vs canonical text, pass threshold ≥80%, AI hints and repeat prompts if failed.
Retell / Oral Comprehension Example: Keyword detection, minimum 2/3 keywords for completion, AI prompts sentence stems if needed.
2.1.4 Gamification
• XP points per activity
• Badges per milestone
• Collectibles (feathers, stars)
• Leaderboards, unlockable content after milestones
2.1.5 Progress Tracking
• Per lesson completion status
• Time spent on activities
• Engagement metrics: pauses, retries, attempts
2.2 Teacher Module
2.2.1 Dashboard: view class roster, activity status, completion %, reading accuracy, quiz scores
2.2.2 Lesson & Activity Management: create/edit lessons, upload multimedia, assign custom paths
2.2.3 Monitoring & Intervention: alerts for low engagement/completion/accuracy, trigger live teacher support
2.2.4 Reporting: export per-class/student reports, detailed logs of activity completion & ASR results
2.3 Administrator Module
• School management: classes, subjects, boards, assign teachers
• Compliance & verification: track activity completion, maintain audit logs, certificates issuance
• Analytics: school-wide performance, subject-level insights, teacher engagement reports
• Security: role-based access, 2FA optional, encrypted storage
2.4 AI Instructor & Monitoring Module
• Dialogue Management: stage-based AI flows, branching based on performance
• Speech Analysis: ASR transcription, reading accuracy, keyword detection for retell
• Gamification Engine: assign XP & badges, track missions & collectibles
• Intervention Logic: AI prompts based on accuracy thresholds
• Logging & Metrics: timestamp, attempts, time spent, temporary audio sample storage
3. Non-Functional Requirements
• Performance: Support at least 1000 concurrent students per class
• Availability: 99.9% uptime
• Scalability: Add classes/grades, new subjects, multiple AI characters
• Security: HTTPS, encryption, GDPR/India Data Protection compliant
• Device Support: Web, iOS, Android, responsive design
4. Data Model / API Endpoints
Example Tables: Students, Lessons, Activities, Logs, Badges
Example API Endpoints:
• GET /api/lesson/{lesson_id} – fetch lesson content
• POST /api/activity/submit – submit activity results
• GET /api/progress/{student_id} – fetch progress & gamification stats
• POST /api/feedback – AI feedback submission / teacher override
5. Gamification & Rewards Logic
• XP assignment, badges, unlockables, leaderboard updates
6. Activity Completion Verification
• Reading, Retell, Quiz examples with thresholds, ASR keyword checks, logging for teachers/admins
7. Additional Recommendations
• Parent dashboards, AI adaptive paths, offline mode, modular design for curriculum updates, multi-character support
8. Deliverables
1. FRS document
2. Database schema & API design
3. Teacher, Admin, Student dashboards mockups
4. AI lesson JSON templates
5. Gamification engine & leaderboards design
