AI-Driven Learning Core,Micro-Lesson Engine,CORE-US-01,"As a learner, I want every lesson to be broken into exactly five micro-lessons so that I can learn complex topics in small, cognitively manageable steps.","Exactly 5 micro-lessons exist per lesson; each micro-lesson contains Concept, Example, Learner Action, AI Validation, and Reinforcement; system rejects lessons not matching structure.","Generate a lesson strictly divided into 5 micro-lessons. Each micro-lesson MUST contain: (1) one clear concept explained in ≤120 words, (2) one worked example, (3) one learner task, (4) validation logic, (5) a concise reinforcement summary. Do not exceed limits. Output must follow the approved JSON schema. Success = zero schema violations.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Concept Explanation,CORE-US-02,"As a learner, I want explanations that are clear, age-appropriate, and jargon-free so that I can understand without external help.","Explanation matches target grade; no unexplained jargon; reading level validated.","Create a concept explanation for the given grade level using simple language, analogies from daily life, and no unexplained technical terms. Target reading level ±1 grade. Max length 120 words. Reject if clarity score <90%.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Worked Examples,CORE-US-03,"As a learner, I want step-by-step worked examples so that I can see how problems are solved.","Example shows all steps; logic is correct; no step skipping.","Generate exactly one worked example. Show every reasoning step explicitly. No step jumps. Align strictly to the concept being taught. Validate correctness before output.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Learner Action Prompt,CORE-US-04,"As a learner, I want to actively attempt a problem so that learning is reinforced through action.","Each micro-lesson includes one learner task aligned to the concept.","Create one learner task directly testing the concept. Difficulty must be moderate (not trivial, not advanced). Ensure only one correct answer or clearly defined expected response.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Answer Validation Engine,CORE-US-05,"As a learner, I want my answer to be checked and explained so that I know whether I am correct and why.","System returns Correct/Incorrect; provides correct answer; provides step-by-step reasoning.","Validate the learner answer. Output must include: (a) validation result, (b) correct answer, (c) step-by-step explanation. Never say 'just correct/incorrect' without explanation.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Partial Correctness Handling,CORE-US-06,"As a learner, I want partial credit and feedback so that small mistakes don’t block my progress.","Partial answers are detected; feedback highlights exact mistake.","Analyze learner response for partial correctness. Identify the exact step or concept where error occurred. Provide corrective feedback without revealing full solution unless necessary.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Reinforcement Summary,CORE-US-07,"As a learner, I want a short recap so that the key idea is retained.","Each micro-lesson ends with ≤50-word reinforcement.","Generate a concise reinforcement summary (≤50 words) restating the core idea and common mistake to avoid.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Mastery Scoring,CORE-US-08,"As the system, I want to calculate mastery so that learner progress is measurable.","Mastery score updates after each micro-lesson; score stored.","Compute mastery score using correctness, retries, and response time. Output a mastery value between 0–100. Persist result.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Adaptive Flow Control,CORE-US-09,"As a learner, I want the system to adapt based on my mastery so that I neither rush nor get stuck.","Learners with low mastery repeat; high mastery advances.","If mastery <70, repeat micro-lesson with variation. If ≥70, unlock next micro-lesson. Enforce rule consistently.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Error Pattern Detection,CORE-US-10,"As the system, I want to detect recurring mistakes so that targeted remediation is provided.","System identifies repeated error types.","Analyze last N responses to detect error patterns. Tag errors to concept-level weaknesses and suggest remediation micro-lessons.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Multi-Modal Sync,CORE-US-11,"As a learner, I want audio and text to be synchronized so that listening and reading reinforce each other.","Audio aligns with sentence-level text; controls work.","Generate TTS audio aligned sentence-by-sentence with the text. Ensure pause, replay, and speed control compatibility.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Multi-Language Learning,CORE-US-12,"As a learner, I want the same lesson available in my language so that comprehension improves.","Meaning preserved across languages; structure unchanged.","Translate content while preserving lesson structure, difficulty, and examples. Do not culturally distort concepts. Validate semantic equivalence.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,VIBE Prompt Guardrails,CORE-US-13,"As a platform owner, I want AI outputs constrained so that quality never degrades.","Non-compliant AI output is rejected.","Before final output, validate against SMART rules: Specific, Measurable, Age-appropriate, Relevant, Time/length-bound. Reject and regenerate if any rule fails.",Must Have
AI-Driven Learning Core,Progress Visibility,CORE-US-14,"As a learner, I want to see my mastery progress so that I stay motivated.","Dashboard shows mastery per concept.","Expose mastery scores and learning status via learner dashboard APIs. Update in real time.",Must Have
